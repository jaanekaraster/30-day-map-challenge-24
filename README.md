# 30 Day Map Challenge 2024
The 30 Day Map Challenge is an exciting opportunity to dive into the world of cartography, data visualization, and creative mapping! 

Each day offers a new theme, hopefully sparking fresh ideas and pushing the boundaries of traditional mapping. 

Whether it's mapping cities, visualizing movement, or experimenting with new data, every map tells a unique story. Completing all 30 days is an ambitious goal, but it’s all about the journey—discovering new techniques, learning from others, and exploring the many ways maps can reveal insights about our world. 

## This year's focus: Open Source, AI, and Interactive Web Maps

After my maps last year were effectively paywalled, I resolved to depend less on proprietary solutions and go for skill-building instead. This might mean fewer maps completed, but hopefully more skills gained. And gain I did--getting more familiar with Visual Studio Code, Google Colab, Github, HTML/CSS/JS, and other ways to work with data and make maps. 

Check out my maps below--I'd love to [hear from you](https://www.jacobkohn.dev/)!

## Day 1: Points
**Mapping air/artillery strikes in the Ukraine conflict, Jan - Nov 2024**

I started off this year's challenge with a topical map of fatalities in the conflict in Ukraine. I got the data from ACLED's well-curated data set on current and historical conflicts, and visualized it in Kepler, a platform that helps cartographers visualize data, particularly for time series. 

Data from [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/).

## Day 2: Lines
**🐟 Fishing Lines: Charting the Origins of U.S. Seafood Imports (2019)**

![day2 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day2_lines/day2_image.png)

For this day's challenge, I dove into the origins of US seafood imports to make an [interactive map](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day2_lines/index.html).

This map helps viewers explore data on US seafood imports and the percentage sourced from potentially illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU). 

This was my first published interactive web map for a 30-day map challenge topic, using HTML, CSS and JS to gather and visualize the data on a Leaflet map. 

Data from [US International Trade Commission](https://www.usitc.gov/data/index.htm#:~:text=Open%20data%20refers%20to%20publicly,for%20innovation%20and%20economic%20growth.) and [FAO](https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php)

I decided to make today's challenge about cats, a topic which is always Internet-worthy. 

Like the 2023 challenge in which I mapped [crow populations of Mumbai](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/#day-1-points), this one used crowdsourced observations for the underlying data set. The data is aggregated on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations), a site which has pretty much any species you're interested in. Highly recommend! 

In my interactive map, viewers can discover Istanbul's vibrant cat population using my patented (pending) "Cat Scanner" to see crowdsourced observations of our feline friends.

## Day 4: Hexagons
**📥 Voter Registrations in Massachusetts, USA**
![day4 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/day4_hexagons.png)

With the US elections coming up, I thought I'd have an easy time finding voting locations for any state and doing some spatial analysis. Not so! At the local level, many states have PDFs with addresses of voting locations and drop boxes rather than a simple shapefile or CSV with lat-lon coordinates. It wouldn't have been worth my time for this challenge to individually geocode each one. 

So I had to think a bit more generally about how to tell a story using voting data, and settled on voter registrations as a percentage of total town population in Massachusetts. 

The data cleaning process was relatively simple, only involving a join between two CSVs based on town names.

The next challenge was aggregating these observations into a state-shaped series of hexagons, again a task easier said than done. It turns out that this has been done at the [national level (50 states)](https://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/05/11/hex-tile-maps.html), but it's not something that can be done reliably in a programmatic fashion yet. 

I checked out a bunch of tutorials as I was writing a Python script to generate this map including: 
- [An Observable Notebook on tile maps](https://observablehq.com/@gjmcn/tile-maps-us-counties)
- [A GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/smcateer/d810f397f39b4153f0a555d0363b488c)
- [A Carto Map](https://team.carto.com/u/andrew/tables/andrew.us_states_hexgrid/public/map)
- [A Tableau Attempt](https://www.sirvizalot.com/2015/11/hex-tile-maps-in-tableau.html)
- [A D3 gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/hexbinmap_geo_basic.html)
- [A Hexgrid tile blog post](https://andrewbatson.com/2015/07/07/bringing-the-wonders-of-the-hex-grid-tile-map-to-china/)

I got the data on towns and computed the centroids in Python: 

![centroids](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/centroids.png)

Trying to get each town to snap to its neighbors was a huge challenge: 

![force1](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/force1.png)
![force2](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/force2.png)
![force3](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/force3.png)

Eventually some kind of order took shape with the least amount of overlap: 
![force4](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/force4.png)

I also considered the connections topologically as a network. 
![nodes](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/nodes.png)

I tried to develop a programmatic way to position the hexagons, to no avail.

![test2](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day4_hexagons/test2.png)

I struggled for a long time until I found something I was vaguely happy with posting, and by then, it was Election Day.

## Day 5: A Journey
**Follow the LEGO Brick Road**

The [LEGO Group's](https://www.lego.com/en-us) iconic bricks have sparked play and creativity for the young and old. But where are these bricks made, and what's their journey from raw materials cached under the Middle East to your bookshelf? 

This was a fun one--it involved some business intelligence research plus thinking critically about how to best visualize the typical "migration" of a LEGO brick.

I did some research into the LEGO supply chain, paging through sustainability reports from 2018 to 2023, and found a great resource--the [Supplier List](https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/sustainability/assets/blt2613d85f585ebce6/The_LEGO_Group_Supplier_List_-_2022.pdf), which transparently lists its direct suppliers of materials, components, or items used in finished LEGO products (as of 2022). 

After very tediously geocoding these locations (ChatGPT was again moderately helpful), the real challenge began--how to structure the data to show paths, and how to consider each "lifecycle stage" of a given brick. I settled on seven location groupings:
1. Source Location (i.e. raw material like crude oil or rubber)
2. Processing Center (i.e. where raw materials are first processed)
3. Supplier (from the Supplier List)
4. LEGO Production Facility (six worldwide as of this post, with two additional planned; these are respondible for moulding, processing and packing)
5. LEGO Distribution Center (LEGO Hubs, of which there are six)
6. Retail Markets (generalized to regions for simplicity)
7. Disposal (five directly referenced in LEGO Sustainability Reports)

Once the data was organized in this way, it was relatively simple to build an interactive map using HTML/CSS/JS. 

Given the limited open source information on such a complex product supply chain, I was pretty happy with how I thought about the process and visualization. I would love to get some feedback from LEGO on whether my map is at all accurate :)

## Day 6: Raster
**Atul Setu Construction TImelapse, Mumbai, India**
![day6 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day6_raster/sentinel1_timelapse.gif)

This was another simple map that, like the [Brahmaputra River GIF from last year](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/#day-18-atmosphere), got a huge amount of views relative to my other maps despite the low effort. Still, it was interesting to visualize the process of a critical piece of infrastructure connecting two metropolitan areas in the span of a few years. 

## Day 7: Vintage Style
**🗺 The First Map of Mumbai? c. 1507 - 2024**
![day7 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day7_vintage/day7_vintage.jpg)

It's easy to lie with maps (check out [last year's map on California](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-23/#day-11-retro) for a case study). And sometimes it's difficult to discern the line between truth and fiction, if the map is convincing enough. 

That said, today's map was all about vintage. So I did a bit of research into Portuguese maritime history in the Indian Ocean. Here's my summary:  

Not many scholars are aware of a certain Fernando Lopes do Basseinha, a Portuguese cartographer who served on the voyage of Dom Francisco de Almeida in 1505. After landing at Cochin in India, Almeida ordered Basseinha to chart the western coastline in advance of a planned offensive against the Egyptian and Ottoman naval forces.

Basseinha set out with a small crew on his ship, the Santa Aguada. But the next day, a huge storm sank the ship; Basseinha was the sole survivor. He regained consciousness on the shore, where he was greeted by the local fishing community.

And what Basseinha saw completely blew his mind.

An endless city of houses stacked one on top of the other like building blocks, which could fit all of Portugal in a single neighbourhood. The incessant clamour of metal chariots and personal metal horses jockeying for space, fed only by a liquid diet of a strange foul-smelling substance. Serpents of iron that twisted through the city, carrying thousands of workers. Marvelous bridges that spanned entire harbours. Beastly metal birds that made a terrifying noise as they were propelled through the air by a magical force. Huge stone walls behind which wealthy landowners, donatários, resided in fortresses that touched the clouds.

And most perplexing of all…each person, rich or poor, carried a small black rectangle which put them under a hypnotic spell for hours at a time, and through which they could exchange gold using a method of sorcery they called "jipé."

Unfortunately, Basseinha’s story ends here for now. The only proof of his journey is this map (c. 1507-2024), discovered last week in a bottle washed ashore on Juhu Beach. It’s possible he left some clues on the whereabouts of his journal, if we explore this map in detail…

#FindFernando

Now that you've (hopefully) realized that this was all a hoax (or was it?), we can discuss process. The Portuguese were the pioneers of the Age of Exploration, and maps were essential tools of power and conquest for empires at the time. So I thought to take the day's prompt--blending modern elements in a vintage style--to its logical conclusion: A Portuguese explorer transported to the future, to make a map that would have been more at home in his 16th-century shelves. 

ChatGPT helped with an interesting backstory for how this map was originally created, with some believable observations from Basseinha's journal: 

> Vi uma arte estranha e antinatural onde os homens trocam ouro sem o uso de moedas, mas sim através dessas pequenas retângulas negras. Essas retângulas, que eles carregam a todo momento, parecem controlar as vidas das pessoas. Elas não falam com ninguém, mas respondem a elas, e os homens se curvam diante delas como se fossem ídolos encantados. Chamam isso de 'jipe.' Um mistério além da razão, certamente obra de feiticeiros ou do próprio Diabo...A princípio, pensei que fossem uma ferramenta de comunicação, pois não falam, mas parecem guardar os segredos do mundo dentro de suas profundezas. As pessoas os pressionam, e imagens e sons aparecem como por mágica. E ainda assim, ouso dizer, vi um desses retângulos sendo usado como espelho, mapa, livro de contabilidade e até arma, tudo na mesma respiração. São tanto ferramentas quanto maldições, e temo que um dia possam consumir as próprias almas de seus donos.

"I have witnessed a strange and unnatural art where men exchange gold without the use of coins, but instead through these small black rectangles. These rectangles, which they carry with them at all times, seem to control the lives of the people. They speak to no one, yet respond to them, and the men bow before them as though they were enchanted idols. They call it 'jipe.’ A mystery beyond reason, surely the work of sorcerers or the Devil himself...At first, I thought them to be a tool for communication, for they do not speak, but seem to hold the secrets of the world within their depths. The people press upon them, and images and sounds appear as if by magic. And yet, I dare say, I have witnessed one of these rectangles be used as a mirror, a map, a ledger, and a weapon all in the same breath. They are both tools and curses, and I fear that one day they may consume the very souls of their owners."

## Day 8: HDX
![Reach of the Rupee](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day8_hdx/day8_hdx.png)

I promised myself that I would do something easy for this one because I was tired after Day 7’s pseudocartography exercise, but again this became a demonstration of something new. 

Browsing through the data on HDX, I looked for something fairly straightforward in a geography I was familiar with. I settled on ATM data in India, and had the idea to visualize accessibility to cash throughout the country. But this couldn’t be just a simple points-on-a-map effort, no. It would be cooler to normalize the data by population to get a more accurate and granular picture of accessibility in each area. This means: Kontur population data! 

So I brought the Kontur and ATM data into QGIS and performed a simple field calculation to add a calculated column. But as you know, Kontur is a massive data file, particularly for a country with a large area like India. So exporting the result as a GeoJSON meant that I now had a very troublesome file taking up over 1 million KB of storage. With great power comes great responsibility to my computer’s health…

Of course, there are ways to deal with such large files, such as Fused or Tippecanoe. I tried these out, but ended up styling and exporting the map from QGIS. Onward!

## Day 9: AI Only
**Promotional Poster for Wadi Shab, Oman**

![Promotional Poster for Wadi Shab, Oman](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day9_ai/day9.png)

This exercise tested my prompt engineering techniques to get DALL-E to produce some nice promotional posters for Wadi Shab, Oman.

**🎅 Santa's Midnight Journey🕛**

For this day, I wanted to see how I could incorporate time zone data with a fun topic, Santa's delivery schedule. Namely, how does he manage his busy delivery schedule with Earth's time zones, and make his deliveries at exactly midnight in each home? 

This map imagines Santa hitting every time zone at its local midnight--which the [NORAD Santa Tracker](https://www.noradsanta.org/en) doesn't do.  

I really wanted to display aurora data and even found a [data source that predicts auroras using machine learning](https://microsoft.github.io/aurora/example_era5.html), but in the interests of time, that had to be relegated to my “wish list” for later. 

D3 also proved to be harder to wrangle than expected for this map. I spent a long time wrangling the data in D3 and learning how D3 interprets different projections. Apparently it has its own projection and coordinate schema, so the data needed to be converted to that schema before it could be visualized.

The result was a bit laggy, but with the addition of some snowflake animations, helped me build some skills in CSS and time data in interactive maps.

## Day 15: My Data
**Cycling in Málaga**
![day15 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day15_mydata/day15.pdf)

Located in the Costa del Sol region of southern Spain, Malaga is a fantastic place for cycling. It’s a leisurely 30-minute ride to Playa Pinon del Cuervo (Raven Rock), with numerous spots along the way that offer breathtaking views of the Mediterranean.

This map was a good reminder of how to use QGIS' Print Composer effectively for a simple print-worthy map. 

## Day 22: 2 Colours
**Sequin World**
![day22 image](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-24/day22_2colors/day22_1.jpg)

You may have seen those pillows or dresses which have sequins with a dull color on one side and a shiny color on the other. I hadn't seen these before, so I thought there was some serious level of decay going on with the pillows on this couch. Then I realized this could be a great medium for a simple 2-colour world map. 

## Conclusions

This year's map challenge was pretty ambitious as I wanted to make 1 interactive web map per day. It was a strong start that ended with a lot of leftover ideas and project drift, but with some great foundational learnings as I continue building skills. I got more familiar with the HTML/CSS/JS way of making maps and relying more on open source data and workflows to minimize dependencies on proprietary solutions. Probably my favorite maps were the LEGO supply chain and the Cat Scanner. I welcome your feedback!
